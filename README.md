COVID-19 Data Analysis
Project Overview
    • Objective: Analyze COVID-19 dataset to identify key trends and insights.
    • Tools Used: Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn), Jupyter Notebook.
    • Dataset: Global COVID-19 cases, deaths, recoveries.
    
Key Findings
    • Infection and recovery rates varied across countries.
    • Peak infection times differed regionally.
    • Mortality rate was higher in countries with weaker healthcare systems.
    
Visualization
    • Line graphs for infection trends.
    • Heatmaps for regional comparisons.
    • Bar charts for mortality vs. recovery rates.

Key Observations (COVID-19 Insights)
    1. United States (US)
        ◦ Has the highest confirmed cases with some deaths reported.
        
    2. US and Brazil
        ◦ Both show very high confirmed cases, with partial recovery observed.
        
    3. India
        ◦ Despite its huge population, India shows a strong recovery trend and plays a good role in managing the crisis.
        
    4. Papua New Guinea
        ◦ Experienced a sudden increase in cases within a single week.
        
    5. Holy See, Grenada, Dominica
        ◦ These regions appear to have good healthcare systems, reporting no deaths.    
        
    
Conclusion
    • Early response and strong healthcare infrastructure reduced mortality.
    • Data-driven policies essential in managing pandemics.
