Project Overview
    • Objective: Analyze COVID-19 dataset to identify key trends and insights.
    • Tools Used: Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn), Jupyter Notebook.
    • Dataset: Global COVID-19 cases, deaths, recoveries.
Key Findings
    • Infection and recovery rates varied across countries.
    • Peak infection times differed regionally.
    • Mortality rate was higher in countries with weaker healthcare systems.
Visualization
    • Line graphs for infection trends.
    • Heatmaps for regional comparisons.
    • Bar charts for mortality vs. recovery rates.
Conclusion
    • Early response and strong healthcare infrastructure reduced mortality.
    • Data-driven policies essential in managing pandemics.
